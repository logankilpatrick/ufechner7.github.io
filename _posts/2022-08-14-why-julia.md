# Why am I using Julia?

## Introduction

I started programming in 1976 using the KIM 1 and the 6502 machine language.
Since then I learned and used many languages, Assembler, Pascal, Delphi, Basic,
Foxpro, Java, C, C++, Bash, Matlab, Python and more...

Why do I think that Julia is superior to all of them in many (not all)
applications?

## What is great about Julia?

### Reason no one: speed
When you need to process large amounts of data speed is important. 

### Reason no two: simplicity and elegance

### Reason no three: Built-in package manager

### Reason no four: an awsome community

### State-of-the-art solvers for differencial equations

### State-of-the-art optimizers

## Limitations

### Limitations of language/ compiler

#### Compilation and load times

#### For use on embedded systems
Currently, with Julia 1.8 the first issue is the amount of RAM that is needed: Using Julia
with less than 4GB RAM is not very enjoyable. A cross compiler is missing. For these 
reasons writing code for smaller embedded systems is not feasable. The smallest system
I would use with Julia is a Raspberry Pi 4 and a 64 bit OS.

I know that the Julia developers work hard to mitigate these issues, so in a few years
Julia will hopefully also be usable on smaller embedded systems.

### Limitations of the oekosystem
