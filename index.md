## Julia
[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is the most beautiful programming language ever, as easy as Python and as fast as C.

In this blog I want to share some of my experiances in solving technical problems
with Julia.

## About myself
I did a PhD in airborne wind energy at Delft University of Technology and I am now
working at ABB in Delft, The Netherlands on chargers for electric cars.

My main interests are renewable energies, control engineering, philosphy and music.
